<h2>Welcome to Ruff Housing</h2>
	<p>Ruff Housing began when founder, Ashley Christian, decided to take her love for dogs and put it to use in a small town in northwest Missouri. Since 2022, Ashley has been taking dogs in and making them look and feel their best, while giving them all of the love she can in their short time together. </p>

<h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
	<p>Ruff Housing is a doggy daycare that specializes in grooming and nurturing of the dogs. Whenever your dog visits our daycare for the day, they are treated to whichever package is chosen for them, along with all of the affection they allow. Our number one priority is making it a safe place for dogs to play, get groomed, and just be the happiest version of themselves.</p>

<h3>Use of Our Website</h3>
	<p>Dogs are family. Taking your dog to a new place can be scary. Please use our website to navigate our business and explore testimonies, services, and reviews that will leave you more sure of the environment we provide and do not be afraid to reach out with any questions or concerns. Your business is always appreciated. </p>
